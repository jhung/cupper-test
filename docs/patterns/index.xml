      <description>From its inception, the Canadian Museum of Human Rights (CMHR) was conceived as a space that would be welcoming to the most diverse of audiences. Our goal was to ensure that any member of the public, regardless of age, background or ability, could fully experience all aspects of the Museum.
We have achieved that goal by recognizing that this pursuit will never be finished. Instead of reaching a conclusion, we have instead put into practice a system of iterative evolution and progression.</description>

      <description>The Canadian Museum for Human Rights’ architectural design is intended to “create a path for the visitor from darkness to light, and its signature architecture symbolizes hope for a changed world,” said the CMHR’s award-winning architect Antoine Predock.
Mr. Predock’s concept for the Museum drew inspiration from Canadian landscapes of vast prairie skies, snow, icebergs and northern lights. His design was also inspired by Canadian cultures, including Indigenous cultures, as well as imagery of tree roots and outstretched wings.</description>

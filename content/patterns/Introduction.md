From its inception, the Canadian Museum of Human Rights (CMHR) was conceived as a space that would be welcoming to the most diverse of audiences. Our goal was to ensure that any member of the public, regardless of age, background or ability, could fully experience all aspects of the Museum.

We have achieved that goal by recognizing that this pursuit will never be finished. Instead of reaching a conclusion, we have instead put into practice a system of iterative evolution and progression. Throughout this process we have fostered a culture of change and understanding.

As our starting point, we have based our work on the Smithsonian guidelines for inclusive and accessible design as well as the guidelines for the Science Museum in London and the Musée de la civilization. We also adhere to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) web-based accessibility standards and the most stringent criteria under both the provincial and national building codes.

Broadly, inclusiveness has been the CMHR’s methodology, and accessibility has been the outcome. We have achieved this not only with cutting-edge technology, but through nation-wide input from members of the disability community, a partnership between the Museum’s Inclusive Design Advisory Council and the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, and the pioneering Canadian research undertaken by institutions such as the Ontario College of Art and Design University Inclusive Design Research Centre. In addition, the CMHR has created a national testing group to ensure that accessibility standards are met and continue to be maintained.

The CMHR building, as well as its exhibitions, programs and operations have been inclusively designed from the outset, making both our building and its content available in a seamless manner for all our visitors. The CMHR stands as one of the most accessible museums in the world. This guide describes the specifics of how the CMHR has met or exceeded standards for inclusive design.
Purpose
Our goal is to share this information with other institutions and the general public for the benefit of all. Some may use this guide to interpret and apply our accessibility and inclusivity standards in their own ways; others may favour different approaches. We hope that others will share their efforts with us so that we may, in turn, learn from them. In this way the iterative cycle of evolution in consideration, approach, design, solution building, and best-practice/standards can continue.
Guiding Terms
The CMHR acknowledges the fundamental role that the principle of universal design has played in decision-making regarding all aspects of the visitor experience, from the building’s design to exhibition development, education and programming, digital media, our website, and marketing and promotional materials.

The term “universal design” was devised by Ronald L. Mace (1941-98), a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Mace’s concept proposed that products and environments should be designed “to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.” The intent of universal design is to simplify life for everyone by making products, communications and the built environment more usable by as many people as possible at little or no extra cost. In other words, universal design benefits people of all ages and abilities.

“Universal design,” “accessible design” and “inclusive design” are often used interchangeably and may be considered synonyms. However, the CMHR has interpreted inclusive design to have a wider umbrella, embracing diversity in social and economic circumstances while encompassing the universal design ethos. For this reason, this guide uses the term “inclusive design” as a methodology to ensure the Museum meets or exceeds the changing field of accessibility standards.

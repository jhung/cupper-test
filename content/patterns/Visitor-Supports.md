The CMHR is committed to providing an inclusively designed and accessible experience for all visitors. A variety of supports are available to ensure visitors enjoy equal and effortless access to our facilities and exhibits in comfort. Through our ongoing, comprehensive staff training, we ensure that interpretive programming and visitor interactions are inclusive, meeting or exceeding current accessibility standards.

## Support Persons
Admission is free for one person accompanying a person with special needs.

## Service Animals
Service animals, such as guide dogs and hearing dogs, are allowed to ensure the safety of visitors; pets are not permitted.

## Wheelchairs, Strollers, Other Seating Supports
Wheelchairs, strollers, foldable portable cane seats and foldable portable seats are available for visitor use on a first-come, first-served basis at the Museum’s coat check services, on the main level. [insert images]

## Getting Around the Museum
Visitors can access all Museum galleries through inclined ramps and elevators.

### Ramps
A series of inclined ramps, 773 metres in length, at a 1:20 grade as prescribed by the Manitoba building code, provides an accessible path of travel for visitors to all galleries in the Museum. These ramps guide visitors through the Museum from Level 1 through to Level 7; they include dual-height handrails installed along the entire length of the series of ramps.

The ramps are 1,525 mm wide to allow for two-way wheelchair traffic. Resting spots, which include seating with backs and arms, are located at regular intervals to accommodate visitors who require breaks as they ascend or descend from one level to another. The ramps are internally illuminated with 900 metres of LED lights to ensure adequate lighting for navigation within the circulation route. Also included are multiple glass guard rails that allow all visitors to see into the galleries regardless of their viewing height.

The Museum is developing wayfinding iconography that illustrates the length of each ramp section and the number of rest stops for each ramp segment.

### Elevators
The Museum has three elevators to ensure that all Museum galleries are accessible to visitors:
One elevator is located on Level 1 in the Bonnie & John Buhler Hall and stops at all gallery levels.
The second elevator on Level 3 gives visitors access to the galleries on Levels 4 through 7, as well as the Tower of Hope on Level 8.
The third elevator, also located on Level 1, provides access to all gallery floors up to Level 7.

Two of these elevators are glass, while the third is not, providing an option for those who cannot use a glass elevator.

All elevator buttons are within accessible reach of persons in wheelchairs, consistent with Manitoba building code. They are also all available in Braille. Distinctly audible French and English voices indicate to passengers the level at which the elevator has stopped.

## Washrooms
Multiple accessible (barrier-free) washrooms are available on every gallery level. In addition, the CMHR has seven inclusive (accessible and gender-neutral) washrooms on Levels 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7.

## Print Visitor Guides
There are three versions of print visitor guides available at the Ticketing and Information Desk:
A standard, 5.5" x 8.5" visitor guide that uses a 10.5 point sans serif font and 20 point leading, with high-contrast.
A large-format Braille gallery guide, available in both English and French Braille, [insert icon] that contains summarized information, an overview of each gallery and tactile floor maps of each gallery (available upon request).

The Museum also provides a stand-alone guide that speaks to all of the in-gallery inclusive design features that affect visitor experience.

We are also developing a large-print [insert icon] gallery guide that uses an 18 point, sans serif font and leading set at 20% greater (at least 20 point), with high contrast.

## Guided Tours
Visitors can book tours of the Museum and be guided by a program interpreter. These tours are accessible to all ages and abilities through the use of our elevators and only one ascending and descending section of our ramp system.

The Museum also offers self-guided tours (see the Mobile Application section of this guide).

The Museum has wheelchairs available for people who require them to explore the galleries.

People who require American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation can secure this service by contacting Museum staff at least one week in advance.

## Wayfinding
From the building’s inception, CMHR was committed to creating a good, comprehensive wayfinding system. A clear, comprehensive wayfinding system is essential to enable Museum visitors of all ages and abilities to navigate their way through this architecturally beautiful, unique and symbolic building.

Wayfinding is not just an elaborate term for signage. In its simplest definition, wayfinding is “The act of finding one’s way to a particular place” (Oxford English Dictionary). In essence, wayfinding is the act of navigation: It is knowing your point of origin and your destination, following a good route from your origin to your destination, recognizing you’ve arrived at your destination and then finding your way back to your point of origin. A wayfinding system is very important to help people navigate through a built environment.

A good system is particularly important to help people find their way in complex architectural environments such as the CMHR building.  It responds to all of the visitor characteristics (age, mobility, gender, etc.), is geared to first-time visitors or those who are unfamiliar with the building, and offers a variety of redundant wayfinding cues (signs, maps, spoken directions, technology, etc.).
The components of a good wayfinding system can be grouped into two categories: design and operational elements. The CMHR has tried to use as many elements from both categories as possible.

### Design Elements
Wayfinding design elements are aspects of the physical environment that make it easier (or more difficult) for people to find their way:

#### Exterior signs - Types and placement
The three main building entrances – Main Entrance, Group Entrance and the Accessible Drop-Off Entrance – are identified by large ground-mounted pylon signs at the foot of the pathway to each entrance. These signs are readily visible to pedestrians and vehicles alike. Each of these signs illuminates at night to ensure effective visibility. The lettering on each sign is in white, set against a dark field background to give high contrast visibility (see Figure X).

#### Interior architecture and design
The CMHR is a challenging building to navigate because of its architecture. To address these navigation challenges, we have incorporated these design elements into a comprehensive wayfinding system:
* Tactile floor indicators (on ramps and at entrances)
* Even and effective lighting for all circulation areas and for signage visibility
* Ample cues for circulation options (and effort) throughout the building (stairs, ramps, elevators)
* Effective communication of visitor amenities (ticketing, washrooms, coat check, bistro, boutique, etc.)
* Redundant sensory cues (visual, audible and tactile)

#### Interior YAH (You-Are-Here) maps
Numerous YAH maps are provided throughout the Museum to provide spatial orientation for unfamiliar visitors. They have been strategically placed in view of directional decision points such as elevators and ramps.

#### Interior signs - Types and placement
CMHR strives to optimize the effectiveness of our wayfinding sign-based information for all of our visitors through (see Figure X):
* Bilingual signs layout: Copy for both English and French messages is blocked together (rather than English copy followed directly by French copy). This makes the messaging easier to follow.
* Message layouts and arrows: Messages on directional signs for destinations in a single direction (e.g., to the left) are organized by directional grouping (and notated with the appropriate directional arrow), and are alphabetized within each group, regardless of the type of destination (washroom, exhibit, etc.). This allows for, at most, three groupings of directional messages (left, straight ahead and to the right) and makes messages easier to read.
* Tactile letters, upper instead of lower case letters, Braille and content: All directional signs are tactile and in upper case only. (Anecdotal information suggests that upper case tactile lettering is easier and quicker to read.) All tactile letters are also slightly beveled on their edges, contributing to ease of reading for people who read by touch. In addition to tactile lettering, Braille has also been incorporated on all directional signs, which is also a requirement of the Manitoba Building Code. As recommended by accessibility consultants, the Braille used is at Grade 1 level, in both English and French. Floor levels, washrooms, elevators and ramps were deemed as critical information for visitors. Thus, all signs including this information are both tactile and in Braille.
* Degree of colour contrast on signs: All wayfinding signage follows the guideline of at least 90% contrast between the text and the background. This assists all visitors, including those with low vision, by making the signs easier to read.
* Symbols on signs: Use of symbols on wayfinding signs is limited to only the most internationally recognizable signs – the ISA (International Symbol of Accessibility), men and women’s washrooms, and infant change tables.
* Location: The location of wayfinding signage is consistent throughout the building, i.e. it has generally been placed on the right-hand side (direction of flow) of walls. The placement height of the signs is within the reach range of most people.
* Mockups and testing: Prior to signage fabrication and installation, numerous sign mockups/prototypes were created and reviewed for effectiveness and usability by various users.  When we add new wayfinding signage, we create mockups and often critique or test to ensure maximum functional effectiveness for all visitors.

Our wayfinding needs will continue to evolve as the functions of our facility evolve; this is an important component to ensuring continued success of a wayfinding system.

#### Accessible (barrier-free) design elements
The following accessible (or barrier-free) design elements have been incorporated into the facility (see Figure X):
* All three major entrances, as well as the entire facility, are accessible to people with disabilities and to wheelchairs.
* There is an Accessible Drop-Off Entrance where people can be dropped off right at the building’s entrance. Also at this entrance are four parking stalls designated only for vehicles that display a valid provincial parking permit for people with disabilities.
* There are accessible washrooms on every floor.
* There are accessible water fountains on most floors.
* There is an accessible payphone and ATM, both are on Level 1 and both are TTY capable.

See the Visitor Supports section of this guide for additional accessible design provisions for our visitors.

### Operational Elements
Wayfinding operational elements are organizational policies and practices related to wayfinding.

#### Wayfinding leadership, management and maintenance
CMHR’s wayfinding system is an important and operationally-essential component of the Museum’s daily operation. Thus, it is centrally and proactively managed within the Facilities department. This allows for:
* Wayfinding problems and issues (and their solutions) to be analyzed and understood from a wayfinding system perspective
* Wayfinding decisions to be informed and to occur more quickly, resulting in a consistent and coordinated system
* Input from other departments within the Museum as required, particularly Visitor Experience and Engagement, and Exhibitions, Research and Design

#### Wayfinding terminology and language
The terminology on directional signs and maps is an important component of a wayfinding system. We work to ensure the terminology in our wayfinding system is:
* Simple, clear, concise, and easy to understand and pronounce
* Clear and commonly used terminology for basic visitor destinations (e.g., Group Entrance, Main Entrance, Accessible Drop-off Entrance, Bistro, etc.)
* Available in both of Canada’s official languages (English and French) as the CMHR is a federal institution
* On signs with Braille at the (recommended) Grade 1 level

#### Staff wayfinding training
CMHR staff and volunteers are trained in all of the wayfinding tools available to them so that they can not only perform their own jobs but also directly assist visitors to the Museum. Important components of this training are:
* The importance of learning their way around the Museum, both inside and outside
* The various elements of CMHR’s wayfinding system: signs, maps, mobile application, website, volunteers
* How to assist all of our visitors, regardless of their ability, with wayfinding
* How to give accurate and effective directions to visitors

#### Pre-visit information and visit planning
CMHR offers visitors opportunities to plan their visit both before their arrival and on arrival at the Museum in the following ways:
* Visitors may download self-guided tour itineraries from the CMHR website before their visit.
* Visitors can use the mobile application to develop their own visit plan.
* When visitors arrive, staff and/or volunteers are available to help them plan their tour itinerary. They may choose from guided or self-guided tour options.

The visitor planning service ensures that visitors’ needs are met, taking into account the amount of time they have, what interests them, circulation options, use of ramps or elevators, etc.

We also solicit ongoing visitor feedback (surveys, interviews, etc.) to ensure that we are always making improvements.

#### On-site direction-giving
Regardless of the number and types of wayfinding aids available, some visitors will always seek out a human source for getting directions. Thus, Museum staff are knowledgeable and trained in:
* Spoken directions – At some point, all Museum staff are called upon to provide spoken directions
* Escorting visitors when necessary
* Scripted directions
* Awareness of inclusive design wayfinding

#### Wayfinding technology
Wayfinding information is provided on both the Museum’s website and mobile application. This allows the visitor to plan their visit in advance or as they venture through the Museum. Both platforms provide information on inclusive wayfinding features at CMHR.

#### Ongoing wayfinding system maintenance
We manage and maintain the Museum’s wayfinding system by:
* Ensuring ongoing consultation with groups and departments within the organization regarding wayfinding issues
* Overseeing issues and elements (for both operational and design components) related to wayfinding for people with disabilities
* Responding effectively and diplomatically to visitor, staff and volunteer suggestions or complaints regarding wayfinding
* Implementing wayfinding improvements as a result of internal audits and visitor testing and feedback

### Assistive Listening Technology
The CMHR uses induction technology for people who are hard of hearing and who use a hearing aid with telecoil capability. The Visitor Services desk uses a broadcast device, tunable to hearing aids. For in-gallery purposes, neck loops with volume control are available; the neck loops work in conjunction with the audio jack on our Universal Keypads. For information on Universal Keypads, see the Media Production Standards for Exhibits section of this guide.

All media presentations within the CMHR exhibitions include user-controlled volume adjustment via headphone jack or mobile application. Headphones can be requested from visitor services at no additional cost.

### TTY Payphone and ATM
An accessible public payphone and ATM are available for Museum visitors on Level 1. Both are TTY enabled and both installations meet or exceed the minimum measurements (e.g., height, access) to ensure accessibility.
